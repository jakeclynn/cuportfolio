				<h1>
					Morning Hike in the Foothills
				</h1>
				<p>
				

The trail was dry and cold that mid-june morning and the sunrise was just beginning to creep across the foothills, replacing the summer night with a crisp morning air as James began his hike. He recognized the feeling of the morning sun rising behind him and the flatirons standing proud and tall before the cloudless 6 a.m. sky. The popular Flatirons Loop was quiet that morning, James remembers, as he looks at the pictures he took on his phone that day. He scrolls through the photos of green pastures and shadowy pine trees along the barely lit trail until he comes to the picture of his arm filled with I.V. tubes and covered in hospital bands taken only a few hours after he began his solo hike up the Flatirons that morning. </p>

<p>	It was the beginning of a global pandemic, an end of the University of Colorado Boulder senior’s May semester and the beginning of a warm summer in Boulder. The day before the accident, James Hoover had just finished skating and was at home drinking beer and smoking, among other things, something that wasn’t unusual for the 21 year old and many other college students,  in those months over the summer. </p>Benzodiazepine accounts for 31% of prescription overdoses. In a college setting, these Benzodiazepines are often mixed with alcohol and other drugs, making them more lethal. Hoover also knows that the drugs he was taking weren’t prescription, and could have been laced with anything.

<p>Dylan Turner, Hoover’s friend, went over around 8 or 9 pm and remembers Hoover being “already fucked up.” As another normal night played out for Hoover, he remembers inviting friends over, hanging out and continuing to take drugs like Xanax, marijuana and alcohol through the night and early morning. “I remember at one point he just left for like 40 minutes.” Dylan said as he recalls the night. “I was hella addicted.” James says. Drugs were a part of his life at this point and he says staying up all night “getting fucked up” like this wasn’t unusual. </p>
	<p>James was on the couch with his girlfriend Jenna when the clock hit 5 a.m. and the first glimpses of morning came through the window. He looked around and seeing everyone had gone to sleep, he decided it would be a good morning for a hike. He grabbed Jenna’s beige “creative director” sweatshirt and set off on the 30 minute walk to the trailhead. </p>
	<p>Hoover hiked further up the trail, taking pictures and videos of the mountainside as he walked. As he turned a rocky corner of the rock face he noticed two guys chalking their hands as they prepared to scale the face of the second flat iron. Hoover remembers asking the two how hard the climb is before they offered him some chalk and began climbing to the top. </p>
<p>“It couldn’t be that hard; it looked kind of angled.” Hoover remembers thinking in his altered state, before he set his hands on the cold rock face, still warming in the morning sun. “I felt more sober than I was,” He says as he chuckles with a smug smile on his face, now knowing the consequences of his judgement. 
One foot, one hand after the other Hoover climbed until soon he was 30 feet off the ground. The other climbers had reached the top and were out of sight when he felt his right foot slip from its grip on a round patch of the rock. “I was scared, I felt it in my whole body.” James closed his eyes as he tumbled down the face of the rock, hitting his hip, head and back before landing on the dirt and pine needles below. “I remember seeing my phone and wallet flying out somewhere,” Hoover says. </p>

<p>His first reaction was to look for his phone to call 911. With adrenaline pumping through him, James got up and immediately felt the pain in his back and hip when he tried to stand. “I knew I was fucked.” Soon realizing that something was broken, he sat back down and felt the blood against his back seeping through Jenna’s beige sweatshirt. </p>
<p>As quickly as thoughts of dying on the side of the mountain began to creep into his mind, a hiker walked by James’ battered and bloody self lying just off the trail. “Are you okay, what happened?” is all James remembers the man saying before he did a concussion test and called for help. The man stayed with James as he laid on the ground and waited for help. </p>
<p>The morning sky was fully lit when the paramedics arrived to carry James on a gernie down the same trail he hiked up that morning. Hoover woke up in Foothills Hospital around 4 p.m. that afternoon with only a faint memory of the accident. After first being met with voicemail, James said his parents were shocked and upset but glad that he was okay when he called them from the hospital. He told them about falling from the flatiron and the fracture in his vertebrae that would leave him in physical therapy and recovery for months.
“It felt like I was living a second life.” Hoover told me about his mindset after the fall. It’s been a little over four months since the accident and James has had time to reflect on his accident and how it’s impacted him. He talks about the incident in a calm way now, knowing there’s no use in being frustrated or regretful. “I gave em all away, I don’t do drugs like that anymore.,” Hoover said, when I asked if the accident changed how he used drugs. “I don’t even know why I climbed it to begin with, I think I had a lot of confidence from the xanax.” Hoover says, looking up from his phone and the pictures of the trail that morning. </p>
<p>Hoover still skates almost everyday, and he probably won’t ever stop living like he can’t be hurt, but he’s “been humbled” he says. Hoover recently revisited the spot on the flatirons loop trail where he fell, and where another climber had lost their life just the day before we were there. The combination of dangerous climbing routes and an abundance of college students is bound to lead to accidents here and there. Hoover’s new lease on life has reshaped the way he thinks about and takes drugs. He thinks back to the accident and the people in his life that changed his decision making process, like a girlfriend addicted to drugs and a group of friends that fostered clouded judgement. Hoover has changed, in ways that aren’t obvious but are for the best. His hope is for others to not have an experience like his where drugs affected his decision making to nearly a point of no return. </p>


<p>
Memo</p>
	<p>This story is newsworthy for addressing drug use in college culture and how it affects decision making, its relevance to the community, and it’s dramatic subject matter. I wasn’t aware of the drug use involved in James’ accident before interviewing him and it became a really powerful aspect of the story. During the interview process I went with James back to the spot on the trail where he fell in hopes of getting more details from the incident. It was difficult because James’ memory of the incident was foggy from the drug use and hitting his head. Returning to the spot where he fell definitely brought back more information and gave me enough detail to write about. I think this story has very diverse themes, dealing with drug use as well as action and suspense. </p>

	<h2>Ferment Boulder in the Covid Era</h2>


	<p>A few Instagram followers and a natural leavener was all Rafaelo Infante and Andre Gruber needed before they began one of Boulder Colorado’s highest rated bakeries on Yelp and Google. In April of 2020, Gruber was inspired to start Andre’s Bread, making fresh sourdough loaves in his Boulder home and delivering them on his bike to the local community. At this time, he was only selling about one to six loaves a week, until Infante, an advertising major at the University of Colorado Boulder with a sixth sense for social media management, began looking over the company’s Instagram insights from his home in Basalt, Colorado. He realized that during this adverse time as people were isolated in the Covid-19 lockdown, the interactions on Instagram were a promising venue for marketing. More people were liking the posts than there were followers and he saw the opportunity for creating a wide reaching campaign. “I started studying the company pretty religiously and realized that there was a lot of potential.” Infante reached out to Gruber and asked if he could jump on board. After re-strategizing the company and moving in together, the duo began baking and biking everyday. 
	While much of the country was out of work and on unemployment, many Americans quickly began thinking of new strategies for making a living during the pandemic. “Americans are starting new businesses at the fastest rate in more than a decade, according to government data” stated Gwynn Guilford of the Wall Street Journal. More than half a million more employer identification number requests have been submitted in 2020 compared to 2019. Infante and Gruber took advantage of this opportunity and realized that while industries like retail and restaurants that rely on a consistent in-person customer base have been struggling, online services and food delivery services are continuing to grow and thrive. With an understanding of what makes a company appeal to the public in the modern market, the duo made creating a personable and eco-friendly company a main focus. Since its inception, Ferment has delivered only on bike and has made making a relationship with their customers very important. “Half the brand is our product, ya know a lot of customers say we make a phenomenal loaf and that they really like it but the other half is the relationship we have with them.” The Ferment duo prides themselves on writing notes for every loaf and staying to chat with customers outside their homes, which during this difficult time, can send a really positive message. This is something they want to do more of and as their business grows and they gain resources, it’s something they strive for. “We don’t want people to say ‘we’re going to Ferment to grab a loaf.’ We want them to say ‘We’re going to Ferment to see Andre and Rafa and maybe grab a loaf.’” </p>
<p>Ferment’s Instagram page furthers this message. Taking a look at the page, customers will be surprised at the quality and care that goes into creating an experience around ordering bread and visiting their website. The increase in social media marketing has been easily noticeable, and for good reason. “Another consequence of the lockdowns is the extreme increase in the usage of Internet and social media. Previous research has indicated that humans who feel lonely tend to use social media more and, in some cases, even prefer social media over physical interaction” (Nowland, Necka, & Cacioppo, 2018) Boulder is a town of healthy living, and posting about that lifestyle to compliment it. The HD pictures of the flour coated loaves and their hands-on process makes their products not only look delicious, but makes their aesthetically pleasing lifestyle appealing to the young and progressive demographic in Boulder, Colorado. This summer, Ferment paired with local filmmakers Brian Szymanski and Ian Vaso to create “A Baker’s Dozen Story.” This aesthetically pleasing documentary aimed to share their message and origin story with the Instagram community. The documentary showed customers what they were all about and made sustainability and active living a main focus through sequences of the Ferment pair biking around The Hill, one of Boulder’s largest neighborhoods that houses college students and local families alike. Cheyenne Smith, a CU Boulder student and long time customer of Ferment feels like this message is crystal clear and efforts to better the community have definitely shaped their success. “Not only is their bread delicious, hand prepared and aesthetically pleasing, but sustainability is at the forefront of their business model. Ferment Bakery is truly setting an example for others in the community.” </p>
<p>“It wasn’t like we had been baking for an Eternity.” Infante said about the quick turnaround from learning to bake and creating a company with the capacity to reach thousands of people in the Boulder area during a Pandemic. Along with their Instagram presence, Ferment has partnered with nearly half a dozen other companies that have helped further their message of sustainability and active living. Coalatree, Zeal Optics and Growing Gardens to name a few. Coalatree, is an eco-friendly clothing and lifestyle brand that has sponsored Ferment for months and believes in their initiative to better the community and create sustainable products. </p>
<p>While many traditional small businesses have been negatively impacted by the Coronavirus lockdown, there are a few things that have allowed start-ups like Ferment and the online market in general to do just the opposite. Ferment gives the impression of a couple college kids who started a business for fun, although under further examination, their business plan is calculated and conscious about how they portray themselves and how their business model will survive in the midst of a global pandemic. Ferment recently began a subscription service allowing customers to get their fresh sourdough loaves delivered weekly to their loyal customer base. This idea has already brought incredible success to the start up in a town some may call the “avocado toast capital of the state.” In a journal entry published in the National Center for Biotechnology Information this trend has been observed and studied. “Typically, when studying markets, it is assumed that they are static, a natural conclusion since they tend to change slowly. However, if there is one thing the COVID-19 outbreak has shown us, it is that markets are dynamic and can move rapidly. (Jaworski, Kohli, & Sahay, 2020) As Ferment began designing their business model in the midst of the lockdown, their choice in making homemade bread with locally sourced ingredients has lended itself to their success during the outbreak. “Consequently, it is very likely that this pandemic will make these firms rethink their supply chains and, probably, move supply chains closer to where they are needed in order to avoid stopping production in the future.” (Donthu, Gustafsson 2020) A similar approach has led to the success of other local bakeries in the Boulder area such as Great Harvest Bread Co. who’s manager Shannon Smalls said “Buying from local bakeries allows the customer to pay the people who bake the bread everyday a living wage, rather than people who outsource their ingredients and production.”</p>
<p>In the future it is uncertain whether our new habits of shopping online and ordering food for delivery will continue to thrive after the pandemic or if many of these companies like Ferment, that rely on online marketing will fade into the past as explored in  a journal entry by Jagdish Sheth. She notes that while companies who emphasise locally sourced products are currently finding success, many markets such as “middlemen” who buy and resell for profit will likely find their way back into the economy when the pandemic comes to an end. However, she points out that “Digital savviness will become a necessity, rather than an alternative, for schools, businesses, and healthcare providers.” This points to the fact that consumers enjoy ease in their shopping experience and Ferment may have a lasting impact on the Boulder community and the social media marketplace as a whole.</p>

<p>Memo: </p>
<p>This story was a lot of fun to research and write about. Andre and Rafa are two really passionate and charismatic people who clearly care a lot about not only their products, but their community and their message. They were kind enough to let me into their kitchen, showing me the process in how they make bread and what their entire process looks like. They were also helpful in directing me to customers who could attest to their mission and gave honest feedback on how they like Ferment. Researching scholarly work was a bit more of a struggle. I realized during research that I wanted to cover an angle that addressed the company’s struggle and resilience in creating and finding success in a company during a global pandemic.</p>
